infrastructure.

To use this first copy options.yaml-SAMPLE_STAGING or
options.yaml-SAMPLE_PRODUCTION to options.yaml. Next specify your EC2
access and secret key in options.yaml.

Next simply the script run.sh, this should print out the nodes running
in your project on the specified cloud. run.sh should also install
Python virtualenv and any needed Python dependencies.
